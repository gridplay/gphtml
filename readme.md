# GPHtml
## Fork of LaravelCollective's HTML package for Laravel

Did this mostly to keep the project alive and to get rid of those composer warnings.

Yes i know about spartie but that package docs is confusing, not facade friendly and seem to not have the Form::open i want

No code changes yet just a change from v6 to v7 and Class name change from Collective to GP

Oh and PHP min is 8.2 and Laravel min version is 10.0

### 7.0.2 - Nov 22 2024
- Changed Laravel's min to 10 (sorry 9 users but time to upgrade)
- Added support for the upcoming 12 (hopefully no code changes needs to be made)
- Min php is now 8.2
- Composer's minimum-stability is set to stable
- Took out "test" stuff because well, the code works, no need to run tests on it
